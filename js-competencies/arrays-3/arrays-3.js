//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////

// Create a function called sunset that copies the existing array sunsetColors 
// by reference and then changes the first element to "blue". sunset should 
// return the copy of the array.

var sunsetColors = ["brown", "purple", "pink", "red", "orange", "yellow"]


function sunset(){
    let sunsetColors2 = sunsetColors;
    sunsetColors2[0]='blue';
    return sunsetColors2
}


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////

//Create a function called sunrise that copies the value of the existing array
//sunriseColors and then changes the first element to "green". sunrise should 
//return the copy of the array.

var sunriseColors = ["yellow", "orange", "red", "pink", "purple", "blue"]

function sunrise(){
    let sunriseColors2 = [...sunriseColors];
    sunriseColors2[0]='green'
    return sunriseColors2
}


//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////

//What is the difference between pass by reference, and pass by value?
//Uncomment the correct answer!

// var refVsVal = `Passing by value points to the same object in memory; pass 
//                 by reference creates a new object in memory with the same 
//                 values. A change made to a value copy will change both the
//                 copy and the original; a copy made by reference will only 
//                 change the copy's values`

// var refVsVal = `Passing by reference points to the same array in state;
//                 pass by value creates a new array in state with the same 
//                 values. A change made to a reference copy will change both 
//                 the copy and the original; a copy made by value will only 
//                 change the copy's values`

var refVsVal = `Passing by reference points to the same object in memory;
                pass by value creates a new object in memory with the same 
                values. A change made to a reference copy will change both 
                the copy and the original; a copy made by value will only 
                change the copy's values`

// var refVsVal = `Passing by reference creates a new array in memory that 
//                 points to the original array in memory; pass by value creates 
//                 a new array in state with the same memory address. A change 
//                 made to a either a reference copy or a value copy will change 
//                 both the copy and the original`
